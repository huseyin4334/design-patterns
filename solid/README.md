# SOLID PRINCIPLES

- Single Responsibility Principle (S)
  - The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should do one thing, therefore it should have only a single reason to change.
- Open-Closed Principle (O)
  - The Open-Closed Principle requires that classes should be open for extension and closed to modification.
- Liskov Substitution Principle (L)
  - The Liskov Substitution Principle states that subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.
- Interface Segregation Principle (I)
  - Segregation means keeping things separated, and the Interface Segregation Principle is about separating the interfaces.
- Dependency Inversion Principle (D)
  - The Dependency Inversion principle states that our classes should depend upon interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete classes and functions.
