        A pattern in which the object's behavior is determined by its state.
        An object transitions from one state to another (something needs to trigger a transition).
        A formalized construct which manages state and transitions is called a state machine.

        State Machine: A state machine is a behavior that specifies the sequences of states an object
        goes through during its lifetime in response to events, together with its responses to those events.
